Changes from 1.1:
-various bugfixes
-added Weapon finishes, these are additional components for the relevant weapons.
-added bullet proof tyres in vehicle mod menu, they are also saved when saving a car, please be aware that if Vehicle god mode is enabled, you'll get those regardless of how you saved the car.
-added no menu wrap and menu sound for num4/num6 navigation.
-added warning message when trying to change chrome wheel color.
-added stunt jumps in other teleports menu. Thanks to Flavaone for providing them to me.

-added Set Vehicle Health
-added lock/unlock vehicle doors
-added silence alarm when stealing 
-added Vehicle Rotation 90 degrees
-added Destroy / Fix Vehicle Engine
-added walking styles (both for player and bodyguard/ped) currently about 69 styles are available but more research is needed as there bound to be more
-You can now fully customize the Vehicle God mode, on Vehicle options menu, the second option lets you enable or disable individual options that are part 
of Vehicle God mode. (this is similar to the special car god mode in IV trainer). Those option will also be saved when using save all settings. 
The last option (Auto Repair) basically overwrites most of the other options and will simply repair the car when damage occurs. 
Other than on IV, this should have a lesser effect on the ability to break windows and other stuff (thanks to arewenotmen for finding the native that allows this).
Also the first option (Prevent Vehicle Damage) will also overwrite some of the other options (the proofs options). 
Of course for any of this to work, Vehicle god mode needs to be enabled (first option on Vehicle options menu).

Changes from 1.2:
-added several teleports to interiors, mostly mission stuff (sunken cargo ship, two ufo's, plane and train crash and some other interiors).
-added peyote teleports in other teleports, thanks to Gforce for providing them to me.
-fixed issue with time setting forward/backward and not taking hours into account.
-when enabling cargod mode and disabling tyres can't burst, it wasn't possible to enable bullet proof tyres in Vehicle mod menu, this has been "fixed", 
when car god mode is enabled together with tyres can't burst, it remains impossible to disable bullet proof tyres in vehicle mod menu. This is by design.
-changed blip color for attacking and combat ped to unfriedly.
-weapon tints and attachments can now be used with bodyguards/peds, both before spawn and after using the ped task menu.
-Gravity gun makes a return, works on peds, cars and objects, just aim at the desired ped, car or object, aim again to attach, move and shoot or drop.
force settings can be set in game and are saved with save settings.
-airbreak forward and up speed are now configurable in game and added to save settings.
-fixed walking styles, most should now work.
-reviewed controller support, you can now enable or disable controller support via options menu (second page). 
If enabled more game controls are being disabled whilst the menu is displayed or whilst airbreak or hydraulics is enabled, if disabled these controls are not 
disabled and keybindings for controller are automatically unbinded. This settings supports the save settings function, so no need to do anything in the ini 
for controller settings. In addition I changed the dpad right/left scrolling for controller and added controller support for airbreak,hydraulics and Gravity Gun.
-added spawn weapon by model name.
-Parachute settings menu off Weapons menu, allows you to equip the primary and secondary parachute, allows you to set the tints for both 
allows you to set the parachute smoke color and includes unlimited parachutes. Those settings are saved when save settings option is used.

-Player wet and player dry
-Added quite a few interiors in the interiors teleport off other teleports menu.
-Voices return, unfortunately they don't work quite the same way as in IV. First of all there are only a relatively small number of speeches,
also changing voice for player is not working and for peds this is only supported for the ambient ped models (so no player model).
In any case, for player you can play a select number of speeches, whilst for bodyguard /peds you can also change the voice (providing it's a normal model).
-Vehicle Texture corrosion (for lack of a better description), on select vehicles, such as the Canis Bhodi, you can set the Texture corrosion. Thanks to arewenotmen for finding natives. This will also taken into account when saving and loading vehicles.
-added move_m@multiplayer to walking styles.
-some cutscenes don't play which causes the trainer to stall. I have added a 10 second wait, if after 10 seconds the cutscene doens't start the trainer will give up waiting and will return normally.
-added Add Waypoint to Mission Marker, press Pagedown (or use option in mission menu) and a waypoint will be placed on the mission marker.
-added the 60 predefined teleport slots to locations off other teleport menu, so you can just overwrite them without loosing them.
-controller support for vehicle rockets (B) 
-change open menu for controllers to just X, menu cancel is just RB.
-added Bailbonds to pickup teleports (thanks to choc4444  for providing those).
-fixed vehicle god mode not being disabled in the last car the player used.
-added additional keybinds, RCTRL+0 for lock car and various stuff using I+num keys.

-Attacking cars will now be removed after some time (by the game).

-fixed parachute tints not being applied on game start
-key for Vehicle god mode G+9

-preview object is available when in objects 1 - objects 6, Holding X will preview the selected object.
-object move speed and rotation speed are saved when save settings is used, this can be set in the object move screen.

-You can of course move attached objects and detach them

-Added 4 additional Vehicle Color Load/Save slots
-Added "by the book house" to other teleports, interiors.
-Added teleport to Aircraft Carrier and Heist Yaht, for this a separate mod is needed. (http://gtaforums.com/topic/810029-heist-map-updates-in-single-player/page-3#entry1067794362 )

Changes from 2.0
-added the 5 highlife apartments, the lobbies and the police station for which a separate mod is needed (http://gtaforums.com/topic/810029-heist-map-updates-in-single-player/page-3#entry1067794362 )
in other teleports, Heist /High Life interiors, this is also where the Aircraft Carrier and Heist Yaht can be found.
-added three missing high level apartments in other teleports, interiors.
-ability to set player Health, from 100 to 7000, be sure to disable special god mode for this to work.

Changes from 2.1
-Thanks to Flavaone, quite a few teleports have been added or corrected. 
-Many interios have been added, thanks to Taazr for his video, which I used to add those.
-Blackout in options menu 2.
-Weapon Damage modifier, enable and set the modifier, saved when using save all settings, both weapon and melee modifiers are enabled, this allows for one hit kills.
-Ability to set Tattoos for Player Models and MP-freemode Male and Female models. Both for the player and for bodyguards/peds, also ability to save using the save clothes slot. Be aware that I cannot detect tattoos, 
so only the tattoos set by trainer will be saved and loaded. For Bodyguards, you can only save the one you last used when visiting the tattoo menu.
-Ability to set the color for Clock, Speedo, Coords, Player Health and Vehicle Health display. (options menu second page).
-Fixed the issue where after spawning two combat peds all peds fight each other.
-The above issue can be re-created and reset by using the Relationship menu (options menu page 2) which returns from IV trainer, you can set relationships between two groups and reset them. 
First Select the two groups and then select relationships and press Num 5 on relationships.
-Changed everyone ignore, hopefully works better now, otherwise try and use the relationship menu. 
-Ability to set pearls from all 160 colors instead of only 85.
-Another feature returns: Added Vehicles, ability to set model name, display name in added cars sections of trainerv.ini, each slot needs to be enabled in ini.
-Some mods with keybinds to single keys would prevent you from using those keys into functions where text input is needed, such as spawn by model name, I have changed those functions 
and it should now be possible to use these keys whilst those mods are running.
-Keybinds, J+ num 8 for increase and J+ num 9 for decrease wanted level, S+ num 1 to equip a silencer on the fly.
-new task for peds: Follow.
-Attached Vehicles Menu (Object Menu, Attached Objects menu) which allows to attach a vehicle to another vehicle and move it in position. You can select amongst the last 5 spawned vehicles, providing they still exist.
-ability to specify a subfolder in V's main folder to search for ini files for object spawning, this ensures ini files in V's main directory are not included, 
you need to specify the folder in defaults section of trainerv.ini, for instance if you want to use the folder Map Mods, you would do the following: ObjectIniFolder=Map Mods,
this will make the trainer search for ini files only in main V folder\map mods, and will therefore not search in the main V folder for ini files. You of course need to move the objects ini files to the same folder.
if you don't set the value, it will continue to search for ini files in the main V folder and all subdirectories of the main V folder.
-Ability to switch between the normal SP map and the DLC2 MP map, this enables the Heist Yacht and Carrier to be loaded without any additional mods required,
this will also enable the updated High end Apartments, some lobbies, the police station and the High Life Apartments. You can switch back and forth on the fly
but be aware switching will take some time, game appears to be frozen, but it's just loading/unloading in the background. Credits to Guadmaz for finding the natives that allow for this.
this function can be saved at game start, just enable MP map, use save all settings and the next time you will start with the MP map, it will also auto load the Yacht and the Carrier.
Be aware that we found some downgrades to the safe houses and that playing with the MP map enabled might not be compatible with some story line missions, you have been warned.
-Alexander Blade has fixed the object limit (250) and will release a new version of his hook in the near future. I have therefore increased the number of objects I track
to 2048 (which is the absolute limit). Also 500 objects will now be saved to ini file instead of 250 previously. I was able to spawn as many as 1855 objects in game, but this number might
be lower in different areas of the map. The trainer will no longer crash when you have exceeded the limit. 
For this to work, you need to wait for Alexander Blade to release the newest scripthook, which should be soon.

Changes from 5.0
-weapons damage multiplier will again work for melee, blame R they added a new parm in between...
-fixed a bug where some teleports in interiors would be wrong or would not remove certain IPL's.
-the get all weapons function now also gets all weapon attachments. Both when run from the menu or using the RALT+NUM7 keybinding.
-added several teleports locations for each yacht.
-ability to set the yacht name. Sometimes if you get too close, the name disappears, no idea why.
-you can use the radio in the yachts (total of 4 radios for each yacht), press E or LB on controller to switch on/off use Right Arrow/Left Arrow or Dpad Right/Left for station up/down.
-Tv is also usable on the yacht, same controls as the radio.
-Since I had to do the TV for the yacht, I added an enable TV function on the teleport menu, so TV's should work in apartments, go near the TV and enable the function on the menu (teleports, other teleports). 
There are about 17 or so models on which the TV works, inlcuding the monitors in the heist rooms. You can spawn tv objects and enable the TV on them as well.
-Apartment Radio, enabling this will make the radios work in various interiors. You can press E or LB on controller to enable the radios, many apartments have three different radios, most 
other interiors have just one radio. Each one can be enabled and the station set (left/right arrow, or Dpad left/right on controller). Both the option itself as the state and station
of each radio that is enabled will be saved when save settings is used. So that on each game session those radios will play when you are inside the interior and they will play the same station
as they were when you used save all settings. The interiors that have radios are the 19 High end Apartments and the midrange and low end apartments and the high, mid and low end garages
in the other teleports, interiors option,  the 5 upgraded apartments and the 10 stilt apartments in heist teleports, The custom suites, the Offices and warehouses, 
all of the MP biker teleports (using 4 hidden stations for all of those) and the import/export teleports. 
In total there are 101 interiors that have the radio enabled, for a total of 217 radios :) I have also added radios to the safehouses, they will work
the first time you teleport, but might stop working as the game does stuff with those radios as well. They will work providing you use the locations teleport option in other teleports. 
Also a radio has been added to other teleports, interiors, Bahama Mama's, in this case you cannot change the radio station and the radio is enabled when you teleport in.
-ability to override the fix for infinite loop when dying as non player model, this is NOT saved when save settings are used because it can potentially get you an infinite loop, use with care.


Ini changes:
ApartmentRadio=0	//Apartment Radio
OverrideLoopFix=0 	//override infinite loop fix 

Radio stuff (this will automatically be added the first time the option is enabled and save settings is used)

Changes from 5.1

Changes from 5.2
-support for latest patch.

Changes from 5.6

-fixed issue with setting ammo and the new ammo types.
-fixed a few issues with weapons and change model, now livery color and new ammo types should work fine.
-if you use get all weapons using keybind, this will also take the setting MaxedOut into consideration
-added ability to quickly go to the second column on menus that have two columns. Num 9 to go to the second column, Num 7 to go back to the first. Can be set in Ini.
-ability to save all weapons to weaponsx.ini (20 slots). All weapons, their attachments, tints, livery colors and Ammo are saved and can be loaded.
Be aware, this shitty game has a problem with the new ammo types, and require waits for the correct ammo to be applied. I have no idea why, in any case, I am not prepared
to wait my code for any longer than strictly necessary. So if any of those new 6 weapons, using the new ammo types have 0 ammo instead of what it should be, either 
set the ammo manually, or..... load the slot again, as that seems to fix the issue. I have no idea why, it simply executes the EXACT same code.

ini changes:

Keybindings
MenuKeyQF=105		//Menu Second Column, Default Num 9
MenuKeyQB=103		//Menu First Column, Default Num 7

Changes from 5.7
-fixed an issue where when changing characters, the no helmet option would not work.
-added a 2 second wait to fix the above issue...

normal weapons section, I cannot be bothered atm, they work, and that's all that counts...

-I started with the ability to save some interiors in the ini, only two biker teleports current work, but I will over time add others.
The supression of the recording UI when using dpad down on the controller does not work, again I need access to the scripts to find the new global.

No ini Changes

Changes from 6.1
-Fixed issue with unlimited ammo and the new weapons
-Fixed the Dpad Down bringing up the character selection screen, it will however still show the recording UI, again until I have decompiled scripts this cannot be fixed.

when you subsequently re-teleport (including with another game session) you will revert to the saved interior.
-The IPL loader, now is a IPL/Interior Prop Loader, allows you to add interior props to interiors yourself and load IPL's.
-The Recording UI is now surpressed when using Dpad down when using the menu.
-Added 80 more vehicle save/load slots. Now 200.

No ini Changes

Changes from 6.3

are being retained. This seems to fix the problem and allows me to have a single function instead of duplicate functions.
-All the Biker, Import/Export, Gun Running, Smugglers and Doomsday Teleports that are customizeable can now be saved to the ini.

No ini Changes

Changes from 6.4

ini Changes:
Keybindings:
ControllerAirbreak1=203		// Default X
ControllerAirbreak2=86		// Default LS

Added Vehicles:
40 additional slots

You can just retain the ini, just copy the two lines under keybindings changes over to your existing ini (under keybindings), which is optional if you don't intend on changing it anyway. 
You can also copy the  40 additional added vehicle slots, copy from Enable281=0 until DisplayName320=Car 320 over to your existing ini (under added cars),
again optional if you don't use those slots. 

Changes from 6.5
-added Infinite Stamina in options menu 1. If enabled it will get saved when save all settings is used. 
-added Restricted Areas, enabled by default, if disabled, you will be able to visit the prison, fort Zancudo and the Airport without being attacked,
will get saved when save all settings is used. 
-Fixed an issue with the Vehicle load/save slots, it was trying to retrieve the full car name (new method), but lead to a crash when the model was not in the game files, this has now been corrected.

No ini Changes

Changes from 6.6
-Added 40 save clothes slots for Player and 40 for Bodyguards/Peds
-Ability to add or remove Crew Emblems to Vehicles, thanks to Mafins for providing me with the offsets. The emblems are also saved when you save the vehicle.
Be aware not all cars are definied, The offsets for the Emblem are taken from the Car mod shop script, and R has definied a total of 302 vehicles there, all the others get
the emblem applied on a default spot, which might not at all be visible. Furthermore R apparently made 4 mistakes, as the Surfer, Surfer2, Avenger and Autarch don't display the emblem.
-Again thanks to Mafins who pointed out a single native, I now have separated controller and keyboard support, this means for instance
that enabling controller support, will not suddenly enable the arrow keys working in the menu.
-Ability to change the office text, font and color for the four offices. And to save these plus the selected IPL to ini.
-Ability to change the Biker Clubhouses text, font and color for the two Clubhouses. And to save these to ini.

-Boot screen can be enabled (which will disable the Big screen), it will cycle through the boot screen and a black screen.

No ini Changes 

Changes from 6.7
-added 280 additional added Vehicles slots, allowing 600 in total. However you don't need to define them in the ini anymore, with help 
from IKT, I have code running that will detect add on vehicles, the first 600 of them will be added to the added vehicles menu 
automatically sorted by Displayname (including the make name). The added cars section in the ini can therefore be deleted, it will not do anything anymore.
-ability to disable vehicle weapons, in weapons menu, will be saved if save all settings has been used.
-The Livery option in Benny's Mod menu has been moved to the Livery Menu directly off the Vehicle Options Menu 1.
-The Vehicle Components Menu has been moved as an additional category in the Vehicle Mod Menu.
-If you set a timecycle, it wills stay active until you clear it again in the timecycle modifier menu.

Ini Changes:

Deleted added cars section, for existing inis, you can either delete it as well or leave it, it does not really matter.

Changes from 6.8 (Or for the people that don't understand: What is new in 6.9..)
-Ability to disable auto-detect of add-on vehicles, which gives you the ability to define them in the ini again (you can re-use your old added cars section from previous ini), 
this means that the text displayed on the Added Vehicle menu, and the text displayed for each Vehicle save slot for add-on vehicles, will come from the displayname in the ini.
if autodetect is switched on, both will come from the game itself. To enable this, you will need to set DefineAddedVehiclesInIni=1 in defaults section of the ini.
The default remains for autodetection of add-on cars, which means there is no need to set anything up in the ini.
-Improved the auto-detect of add-on Vehicles, for Vehicles, if the vehicle author did not bother to set proper names, I now just get the modelname (thanks IKT).
-Search function added for: Vehicles, Player Models, Objects and Animations. The search results window will allow you to spawn any of the found Vehicles, Player Models Objects or Animations.
I have used some of IKT code for search, so credit should go to him, thanks !
-Thanks to the transmet team, who published a much bigger animation list, I have now replaced mine with the list from them, bringing 105186 animations into the trainer. 
Since there is a search function now, you should use that, rather then the animation options, which will still work, and will now cross all 105186 animations.
-Added the ability to also choose Weapon Components and Color and Livery Color for the MKII weapons in the various Bodyguard/Ped Weapon Menus. 
-Added SNS mkII, Heavy Revolver mkII and Double Action Revolver to Bodyguard/Ped Driveby Weapons.
-Removed the restriction to change wheel color of chrome wheels. 
-Ability to set additional props for the four offices, two biker clubhouses and the facility. Of course these will be saved when save interior to ini is used.
-Privacy Glass for the Facility is another option you can enable. Again will be saved when save interior to ini is used.
For the offices and biker clubhouses, you can enable the additional props under the "set name menu", for the facility this can be done in the facility menu.
-Turns out I missed about 15.000 objects, so they are also added to trainer, making a total of 80709 objects. New menu added, Object List 3. 
I believe I now have ALL objects of the vanilla game into the trainer.

ini Changes:
Defaults: DefineAddedVehiclesInIni=0 
Added Cars re-added to ini, this is only applicable if you choose to disable autodetection of added vehicles, if you want to use autodetection, don't replace or copy anything to your ini.

Changes from 6.9
-Privacy Glass for the facility Bedroom.
-The Tropyhs props in the facility did not change when color of the facility was changed, this has now been fixed.

the weapons, clothes, the type (Bodyguard/Ped/Attacking Ped or driver) and the position are saved, as well as the task when Peds are concerned. 
-Voices and speeches are now mapped, this means that all the voices have relevant speeches. Total of 801 Voices and 50831 speeches. 
Big thanks to Alexguirre who wrote a program to extract the speech names. I am using his list and have added a few more voices from latest patches
those are found under Select Voice 4, Select Voice 1 -3 is using his list. 
-There was a bug in the select current drive-by and select current Bodyguard/Ped weapon, this has been fixed.
-Another bug fixed, when setting wheel color, with custom colors, custom colors would not save when save vehicle was used.
-Yet another bug fixed, saving bodyguard default weapon was not correct.

Changes from 7.1
-Ability to open the safe and gunlocker in the offices.

-some small changes to MOC.(Turret Controls were missing, doors were wrong, doorblocker repositioned).
-ability to use club emblems in the biker clubhouses.
-the club emblems selected for Club House 1 will also be used in the facility.
-there IS a way to have the club emblem in the Facility and the two Biker Clubhouses but you will have to do it manually:
download your clubemblem from social club (save as), start openIV, edit mode, open Grand Theft Auto V\update\update.rpf\x64\textures\script_txds.rpf,
right click, choose new Texture dictionary (ytd), make sure the name is set to crewemblem. Then open crewemblem.ytd and import your crewlogo, making 
again sure the name is crewemblem. Both the dictionary and the file name iside of it should be called crewemblem. Now add the following line 
to trainerv.ini under the defaults section: crewemblem=1. If you followed the instructions correctly your crewemblem (or whatever you have put 
inside the dictiorary) will now be shown in the facility and can be selected in the two biker warehouses. You might want to extract the dictionary
and save it somewhere, because after each patch, it will be gone, and has to be reimported into the rpf file.

Teleport7Slot0] - [Teleport9Slot9] However, you don't need to replace the INI as those teleports have also been programmed into the trainer.

-Added a few Walkstyles, at the end of the list. 
-Ability to open and close the bomb bay doors in Vehicle doors and windows menu.
-Rockstar is using a native to disable the new radio station from being displayed at the radio wheel, and preventing the usage of the station,
but I am using the very same native to enable the station again, so it will be in the radio wheel. I actually also forgot to include the 
blonded station in the default radio function, this has now been corrected. The Los Santos Underground station is also included in the default radio function.

No ini changes.

208 chairs, benches, stools and busstops. Options menu 2nd page, or L+numpad 0.

No ini changes.

Changes from 9.4
-Ability to replace the special ability bar with a bar that works both for boost (nitro) and shunt boost, if nitro is enabled, this will replace the special ability bar
with the bar related to nitro. To use this functionality, add nitro1=1 to defaults section of trainer ini. By default the special ability bar is not replaced.
-Ability to use mines on all vehicles, by default this option is disabled, and same as with nitro, it will only work on vehicles that have the relevant mod applied

have mines. This option will be saved when save all settings is used. Might not work perfectly on all vehicles.

-Support for 1868.4 (Epic games)

as the native support is probably best in this hook: https://mega.nz/folder/X84UwS7a#WoDgLYaQHNed-IX7ETStCA
-For full support, one needs to wait for Blade to release his hook for this version, if something does not work on either of the three alternatives hooks, not ask me, I fully support Blade's hook..

-Added ability to manually enter weapon components in game.
-Added ability to manually define weapon components for added weapons, ini addedweaponcomponents See the provided examples, total of 200 components.
-Fixed some issues with spawned vehicles disappearing when no cars was enabled. When no cars was enabled, and you would spawn a vehicle without entering it automatically or when
you loaded a saved vehicle, the vehicle would disappear within a few seconds. I have implemented a system where those cars are simply persistent. Once you spawn a new car, or when you
load a new saved car, the previous will be made "unpersistent" and will disappear just as normally. When you do not use the no cars function, or when you enabled vehicle blips (which means 
all vehicles are presistent) this has no effect. 
-fix vehicle will now also extinguish any fires.

you engage with pressing x (not holding) and disengage by pressing x again or when it runs out. Sound is back.

I have added 13 more which will load Vehicle save slot 3-15, (1 and 2 are already assigned to a keycombination). This gives you the choice in game to determine 
what model is spawned by using the key, but also exactly what tuning options are applied to it. 
So just to be clear:
LALT+A until LAlT+G remain unchanged Ini Slot 1 - Ini Slot 7
LALT+H until LALT+L new using Vehicle Save Slot 3 - Vehicle Save Slot 7
LALT+M until LALT+N unchanged Ini Slot 8 - Ini Slot 9
LALT+O until LALT+Q new using Vehicle Save Slot 8 - Vehicle Save Slot 10
LALT+R Unchanged Random Vehicle
LALT+S new using Vehicle Slot 11
LALT+T until LALT+U Unchanged Ini Slot 10 - Ini Slot 11
LALT+V until LALT+W new using Vehicle Save Slot 12 -Vehicle Save Slot 13
LALT+X Unchanged Ini Slot 12
LALT+Y until LALT+Z new using Vehicle Save Slot 14 - Vehicle Save Slot 15
